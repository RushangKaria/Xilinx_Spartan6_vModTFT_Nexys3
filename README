II. Description:
This project is a Verilog port of the vModTFT display 
Simple Paint Example found on Digilent website. The original 
VHDL example can be found at the following link:
http://www.digilentinc.com/Products/Detail.cfm?NavPath=2,648,979&Prod=VMOD-TFT

Currently the supported FPGA is Xilinx Nexys3 SPARTAN6.

The Xilinx ISE project as well as the binary has been provided with
this release. Program the FPGA using the bit file and touch the
screen with your finger.

The screen responds to touch and colors the screen in three
different colors depending on where you touch.

Each part of the project can be used as stand-alone 
boiler plate code for other projects.

Please email bug reports to the authors.
